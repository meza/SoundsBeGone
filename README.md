Inspired by my own Misophonia, this mod allows you to disable any sound in the game (vanilla, modded, etc) that you don't like.

It records the sounds you've heard over the past minute of gameplay and allows you to then mute them permanently.

This is a client-side-only mod.

### _Fabric only below 1.20. NeoForge version is available for 1.20.4+._

## Usage

### For Minecraft 1.20 and above:

When you hear something that you never want to hear again, press `B` and disable the sound(s) of your choice.

### For Minecraft 1.19 and below:

If you hear something that triggers you, press ESC, click on MODS, select Sounds Be Gone, click on the settings icon on the top right hand corner and then disable the sound(s) of your choice.
